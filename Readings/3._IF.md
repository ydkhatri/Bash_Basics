# If Statements

The basic syntax for an if statement is:

```Bash
if [[ <some test> ]]
then
    <commands>
fi
```

Anything between the ```then``` and ```fi``` will be executed if the test between the square brackets is true.

## If Tests

Here are some basic expressions for use in tests for if statements.

|**Expression**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|!EXPRESSION|The EXPRESSION is false|
| -n STRING|The length of the string is greater than 0|
|-z STRING|The length of the STRING is zero|
|STRING1 = STRING2| STRING1 is equal to STRING2|
| INT1 -eq INT2|INT1 is equal to INT2|
|INT1 -gt INT2|INT1 is greater than INT2|
|INT1 -lt INT2|INT1 is less than INT2|
|-d FILE| FILE exists and is a directory |
|-e FILE| FILE exists|
|-r FILE| FILE exists and has read permission|
|-s FILE| FILE exists and size is greater than zero|
|-w FILE| FILE exists and has write permission|
|-x FILE| FILE exists and has execute permission |

The difference between ```=``` and ```-eq``` is that ```[0001 = 1]``` will return **false** because ```=``` compares strings. ```[0001 -eq 1]``` will return **true** because it compares numerically.

### Multiple Tests

If you want to perform multiple tests with an if statement then you can use ```and``` or ```or```. And uses ```&&``` and or uses ```||```.

```Bash

if [[ -s FILE ]] && [[ -r FILE ]]
then
    echo "File is useful"
fi
```

```Bash
if [[ -x FILE ]] || [[ -w ]]
then
    echo "File is useful"
fi
```

## Elif and Else

If you want to use else if (elif) or else then the syntax is:

```Bash
if [[ <some test> ]]
then
    <commands>
elif [[ <some test> ]]
then
    <different commands>
else
    <other commands>
fi
```
