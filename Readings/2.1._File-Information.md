# Getting File Information

To get metadata for files, you have to use ```stat```. The structure for a ```stat``` command is ```stat -c "<options>" <file path>```.
Each option in ```stat``` represents different metadata. The valid options are:

- **%a**: access rights in octal (note '#' and '0' printf flags)
- **%A**: access rights in human-readable form
- **%b**: number of blocks allocated (see %B)
- **%B**: the size in bytes of each block reported by %b
- **%C**: SELinux security context string
- **%d**: device number in decimal
- **%D**: device number in hex
- **%f**: Raw mode in hex
- **%F**: File type
- **%g**: Group ID of owner
- **%G**: Group name of owner
- **%h**: Number of hard links
- **%i**: Inode number
- **%m**: Mount point
- **%n**: Filename
- **%N**: Quoted file name with dereferencing if symbolic link
- **%o**: Optimal I/O transfer size hint
- **%s**: Total size, in bytes
- **%t**: Major device type in hex, for character/block device special files
- **%T**: Minor device type in hex, for character/block device special files
- **%u**: User ID of owner
- **%U**: User name of owner
- **%w**: Time of file birth, human-readable; - if unknown
- **%W**: Time of file birth, seconds since Epoch; 0 if unknown
- **%x**: Time of last access, human-readable
- **%X**: Time of last access, seconds since Epoch
- **%y**: Time of last data modification, human-readable
- **%Y**: Time of last data modification, seconds since Epoch
- **%z**: Time of last status change, human-readable
- **%Z**: Time of last status change, seconds since Epoch

If you wanted to get the last access time for all files in a users home directory then you would use:

```Bash
stat -c "%n %w" /home/user/*
```
