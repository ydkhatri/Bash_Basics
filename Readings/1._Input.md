# Input

When you want to ask the user for input you use the ```read``` command. There are two ways that you can use the ```read``` command. Either:

```Bash
echo "Hello, what is your name"
read name
echo "Hello $name"
```

or

```Bash
read -p "Hello, what is your name?" name
echo "Hello $name"
```

In both cases, the format for using ```read``` is ```read <variable name>``` and you can have read act as the prompt as well by using ```-p``` option. If you want to ask a user for sensitive information then you would you the ```-s``` option.
