# Directory and File Management

The three basic commands for directories are ```ls```, ```pwd```, ```cd```.

## ```pwd```

Prints the current working directory. If you use ```-P``` it will not use symbolic links.

## ```cd```

Changes the directory that you are in. It can be relative or absolute.  
Relative:

```Bash
cd ../
# Brings you up one level
```  

```Bash
cd /home/
```

## ```ls```

Shows all the files and subdirectories of the directory of your current working directory.

### Common Options

- ```-l```: Creates a list format with the output.
- ```-a```: Shows hidden items.
- ```-d```: Shows only directories.
- ```-R```: Recurses through subdirectories.
- ```-h```: Puts size in human-readable format.
